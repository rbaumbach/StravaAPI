# StravaAPI

Learning how to use the Strava API w/Objective-C

[Documentation](git@github.com:rbaumbach/StravaAPI.git)

## Notes for getting started

I had to begin by creating a Strava application  

[Create Strava application](https://developers.strava.com)  

I had to login using my own Strava account.  Once I logged in and attempted to create an account, I needed to have the following information:

* Email: My personal email
* Callback URL (Domain only): I used my own domain
* And weirdly, an icon app image which I just created really quickly using preview.

Once I finished this, I was able to get my Client ID and Client Secret.
